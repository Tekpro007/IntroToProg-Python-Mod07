Creating a Shopping List and Storing to Binary
Introduction
In this assignment, I will be creating a script that stores data in a binary file and retrieves it from the file.  I will also be using an error handling to prevent known issues from occurring. 
Creating the PyCharm Project file
Before starting my script, I created a new project in PyCharm and named it assignment 07.  To create the project, I opened PyCharm and selected New Project under the File Menu.  I chose the location to be C:\_PythonClass\Assignment7 and unselected the creation of the main.py welcome script as seen in figure 1.

Figure 1 (Creating Project in PyCharm)

I created the Python script Assigment07.py and put it in the class module into the assignment07 folder.   I then navigated from File->Open in PyCharm to the script Assigment07.py and clicked ok as see in figure 2.

Creating assignment07.py
To begin with, I created a new file called assignment07.py.  I created my gihub repository and put that information in the header of my script.  This is seen in figure 3.
 
Figure 3 Function for adding data
I then proceeded to build the function for saving data into a binary file.  I used my knowledge from the lesson to create the saving of data function as seen in figure 4. 
   
Figure 4 Saving data to a file 
Using knowledge from our lesson, I built the read data from file function that used pickling as well as error handling to let the user know if the script could not read the file.  This is show in figure 5. 
  
Figure 5 Adding new task. 
For the presentation piece of my script, I built an input and used my previous two functions to save the data to a binary file and read it. This is seen in figure 6.

Summary
As part of this assignment, I learned how to save files into a binary file and retrieve the data.  I also learned how to error handling to correct issues that could occur with the script.  As a final part of the lesson, I learned how to create a mark down document in GitHub.
